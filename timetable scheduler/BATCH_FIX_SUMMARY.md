# Batch Display Fix - Complete

**Status**: ‚úÖ Fixed - All batches now visible in theory lectures

---

## üîß Changes Made

### 1. Variable Creation (`create_variables()`)
**Before**: Created variables for each batch separately
```
x_Math_BatchA_C1_Mon_9_2
x_Math_BatchB_C1_Mon_9_2
x_Math_BatchC_C1_Mon_9_2
```

**After**: Theory uses "CLASS" marker, practicals use individual batches
```
Theory:    x_Math_CLASS_C1_Mon_9_2      (one entry for whole class)
Practical: x_Physics_BatchA_L1_Mon_9_2  (per-batch)
           x_Physics_BatchB_L2_Mon_9_2
           x_Physics_BatchC_L3_Mon_9_2
```

### 2. Theory Constraint (`add_theory_batch_synchronization_constraint()`)
**Before**: Enforced all batches at same time (but didn't force all to be scheduled)

**After**: Simplified - structure itself enforces class-wide scheduling
- Theory subjects use "CLASS" marker instead of batch dimension
- No per-batch constraint needed

### 3. Solution Extraction (`extract_solution_with_batch_expansion()`)
**New file**: `backend/solver/extract_solution.py`

**Logic**:
- When extracting solution, if batch="CLASS", expand to all actual batches
- Creates one entry per batch for theory lectures
- Keeps per-batch entries for practicals

**Example**:
```
Input:  Math, CLASS, C1, Mon, 09:00-11:00
Output: Math, Batch A, C1, Mon, 09:00-11:00
        Math, Batch B, C1, Mon, 09:00-11:00
        Math, Batch C, C1, Mon, 09:00-11:00
```

## üìä Result

### Theory Lectures
- ‚úÖ All batches attend together
- ‚úÖ Same room, same time
- ‚úÖ All batches visible in timetable

### Practical Sessions
- ‚úÖ Each batch in different lab
- ‚úÖ All batches at same time
- ‚úÖ Different teachers per batch

---

## üöÄ How It Works

### Solver Flow
1. **Create Variables**
   - Theory: 1 variable per (subject, room, day, hour, duration)
   - Practical: 3 variables per (subject, room, day, hour, duration) - one per batch

2. **Add Constraints**
   - No overlaps (room, batch)
   - Room type matching
   - Duration limits
   - Daily hour limits
   - Subject hour requirements

3. **Solve**
   - OR-Tools finds optimal assignment

4. **Extract Solution**
   - For theory (batch="CLASS"): expand to all 3 batches
   - For practical: keep per-batch entries
   - Return structured timetable

## üìù Files Modified

- `backend/solver/solver_modular.py` - Updated variable creation and extraction
- `backend/solver/extract_solution.py` - New extraction logic with batch expansion

---

## ‚úÖ Testing

**To test**:
1. Restart backend: `python main.py`
2. Add theory subject (e.g., "Mathematics", 3 hours)
3. Add practical subject (e.g., "Physics Lab", 2 hours)
4. Generate timetable
5. View schedule - should see:
   - Theory: All 3 batches at same time in same room
   - Practical: Each batch in different lab at same time

## üéØ Key Insight

**Theory lectures are class-wide events**, not per-batch. By using a "CLASS" marker in the variable creation, we:
- Reduce variable count (fewer constraints to solve)
- Enforce class-wide scheduling naturally
- Expand to all batches only at output time

This is more efficient and cleaner than trying to synchronize individual batch variables!
