## 🧩 Core Components

### 1. **models/data_models.py**
Pydantic models for data validation:
- `Room`, `Subject`, `WeekConfig`, `SpecialSession`
- `TimetableRequest`, `TimetableResponse`, `TimetableSlot`, `Conflict`
- Automatic validation and error messages

### 2. **models/timetable_solver.py**
Main solver using OR-Tools CP-SAT:
- `TimetableSolver` class orchestrates the solving process
- Generates time slots based on week configuration
- Creates CP-SAT variables and constraints
- Extracts and formats solution

### 3. **models/constraints.py**
Defines all hard constraints:
- No teacher overlap
- No room overlap
- No batch overlap
- Lunch break constraint
- Subject hours constraint
- Room type constraint
- Consecutive hours constraint
- Special session constraint

### 4. **models/utils.py**
Helper functions:
- Time conversion (HH:MM ↔ minutes)
- Time slot generation
- Feasibility checking
- Slot merging and formatting

### 5. **routes/timetable_routes.py**
Timetable generation endpoints:
- `POST /api/timetable/generate` - Main endpoint
- `GET /api/timetable/status` - Solver status
- `POST /api/timetable/validate` - Validate request

### 6. **routes/department_routes.py**
Department CRUD operations:
- Create, read, update, delete departments
- Add/remove subjects from departments

### 7. **routes/room_routes.py**
Room management:
- Create, read, update, delete rooms
- Filter by type, location, subject

### 8. **routes/settings_routes.py**
Configuration management:
- Week configuration
- Special sessions setup
- Settings reset

---

## 🔄 Workflow

```
1. Frontend collects data:
   - Week configuration (hours, break times, working days)
   - Departments and subjects
   - Rooms and labs
   - Special sessions (optional)

2. Frontend sends POST /api/timetable/generate

3. Backend processes:
   - Validates input with Pydantic
   - Creates TimetableSolver instance
   - Generates time slots
   - Creates CP-SAT variables
   - Adds constraints
   - Solves with OR-Tools
   - Extracts solution

4. Backend returns:
   - Timetable (if feasible)
   - Conflicts (if any)
   - Metadata

5. Frontend renders:
   - Timetable table
   - Highlights conflicts in red
   - Shows statistics
```

---

## ✅ Constraints Implemented

All constraints are **hard constraints** (must be satisfied):

### 1. No Overlaps
- No teacher teaches two classes at same time
- No room hosts two classes at same time
- No batch attends two classes at same time

### 2. Availability
- Teachers only during available times
- Rooms only during available times

### 3. Break Time
- No classes during lunch break (configurable)

### 4. Duration
- Theory: max 2 consecutive hours
- Lab: exactly 2 consecutive hours
- Each subject scheduled for required hours

### 5. Room Type
- Theory classes only in classrooms
- Lab classes only in lab rooms

### 6. Special Sessions
- Mini-projects, tutorials respect their constraints

## 💻 Frontend Integration

### React Example
```javascript
async function generateTimetable() {
  const payload = {
    department: "Computer Engineering",
    week_config: {
      week_start_time: "09:00",
      week_end_time: "16:00",
      lunch_start: "13:00",
      lunch_end: "14:00",
      working_days: ["Mon", "Tue", "Wed", "Thu", "Fri"]
    },
    rooms: [...],
    subjects: [...],
    special_sessions: {}
  };

  const response = await fetch("/api/timetable/generate", {
    method: "POST",
    headers: { "Content-Type": "application/json" },
    body: JSON.stringify(payload)
  });

  const data = await response.json();
  if (data.status === "success") {
    renderTimetable(data.timetable);
  } else {
    showError(data.message);
  }
}
```

## 🧪 Testing

### Health Check
```bash
curl http://localhost:8000/health
```

### Create Department
```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:8000/api/departments/ \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "department_name": "Computer Engineering",
    "subjects": [
      {"name": "DBMS", "type": "theory+lab", "hours_per_week": 3}
    ]
  }'
```

### Create Rooms
```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:8000/api/rooms/ \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "rooms": [
      {"name": "Room 101", "type": "classroom", "capacity": 60, "location": "Building A"}
    ]
  }'
```

### Generate Timetable
```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:8000/api/timetable/generate \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "department": "Computer Engineering",
    "week_config": {...},
    "rooms": [...],
    "subjects": [...],
    "special_sessions": {}
  }'
```

## 🔍 Debugging

### Enable Detailed Logging
```python
# In main.py
logging.basicConfig(level=logging.DEBUG)
```

### Check Solver Status
```bash
curl http://localhost:8000/api/timetable/status
```

### Validate Request
```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:8000/api/timetable/validate \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{...}'
```

## 🚨 Common Issues

### "Connection refused"
- Ensure backend is running: `python main.py`
- Check port 8000 is available

### "Validation error"
- Check data types match Pydantic models
- Verify time format is "HH:MM"
- Ensure day names are valid

### "No feasible solution"
- Total hours must be ≤ available slots
- Check room types match subject types
- Verify working days are configured

## 📈 Performance

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Typical solve time | 1-60 seconds |
| Max subjects | 50+ |
| Max rooms | 100+ |
| Max time slots | 100+ |
| Solver timeout | 60 seconds (configurable) |

---

## 🔐 Security Considerations

- ✅ Input validation with Pydantic
- ✅ CORS middleware configured
- ⚠️ No authentication (add for production)
- ⚠️ In-memory storage (use database for production)
- ⚠️ Configure CORS origins for production
