## 🏗️ Architecture

### 4 Core Components

#### 1. **Utilities Module**
Functions for common operations:
- `generate_time_slots()` - Create valid time slots excluding lunch
- `check_feasibility()` - Quick feasibility check
- `get_available_rooms_for_subject()` - Filter rooms by type

#### 2. **Variables Module**
CP-SAT variable creation:
- Creates boolean variables for all possible assignments
- Variables: `(subject, batch, room, day, hour, duration)`
- Supports flexible durations (1-2 hours)
- ~8,400 variables for typical problem

#### 3. **Constraints Module**
8 individual constraint functions:
1. `add_no_overlap_constraints()` - Room/batch/teacher conflicts
2. `add_room_type_constraints()` - Theory→classroom, Practical→lab
3. `add_theory_batch_synchronization_constraint()` - All batches together
4. `add_practical_batch_synchronization_constraint()` - Simultaneous practicals
5. `add_duration_constraints()` - Theory ≤2h, Practical =2h
6. `add_daily_hours_limit_constraint()` - Max 2h/day/subject
7. `add_subject_hours_constraint()` - Exact hours per week
8. `add_teacher_fatigue_constraint()` - Max 3 consecutive hours

#### 4. **Solver Module**
`ModularTimetableSolver` class:
- Orchestrates model creation
- Adds constraints in sequence
- Handles solving and error cases
- Extracts and formats solution

## 🔧 Core Hard Constraints

### 1. No Overlaps
```
- No room can host two sessions at same time
- No batch can attend two sessions at same time
```

### 2. Room Type Matching
```
- Theory only in classrooms
- Practical only in labs
```

### 3. Theory Batch Synchronization
```
- All batches attend theory together
- Same time, same room, same teacher
```

### 4. Practical Batch Synchronization
```
- All batches run practicals simultaneously
- Each batch in different lab
- Different teachers per batch
```

### 5. Duration Constraints
```
- Theory: max 2 consecutive hours
- Practical: exactly 2 hours
```

### 6. Daily Hours Limit
```
- Max 2 hours per subject per day per batch
```

### 7. Subject Hours
```
- Each subject gets exactly required hours per week
```

### 8. Teacher Fatigue
```
- No teacher >3 consecutive hours without break
```

## 📊 Input/Output Format

### Input (from Frontend)
```json
{
  "week_config": {
    "working_days": ["Mon", "Tue", "Wed", "Thu", "Fri"],
    "week_start_time": "09:00",
    "week_end_time": "16:00",
    "lunch_start": "13:00",
    "lunch_end": "14:00"
  },
  "subjects": [
    {"name": "Math", "type": "theory", "hours_per_week": 3},
    {"name": "Physics", "type": "theory+lab", "hours_per_week": 5}
  ],
  "rooms": [
    {"name": "C1", "type": "classroom", "capacity": 60},
    {"name": "L1", "type": "lab", "capacity": 30}
  ]
}
```

### Output (Success)
```json
{
  "status": "success",
  "timetable": [
    {
      "subject": "Math",
      "batch": "Batch A",
      "room": "C1",
      "day": "Mon",
      "start_hour": 9,
      "end_hour": 11,
      "duration": 2,
      "type": "theory",
      "start_time": "09:00",
      "end_time": "11:00"
    }
  ],
  "stats": {
    "total_slots": 25,
    "subjects_scheduled": 5,
    "batches_scheduled": 3
  }
}
```

### Output (Failure)
```json
{
  "status": "failed",
  "reason": "Need 25h but only 15 slots available"
}
```

---

## 🚀 Usage

### Direct Python API
```python
from solver.solver_modular import generate_timetable

result = generate_timetable(
    week_config=week_config,
    subjects=subjects,
    rooms=rooms,
    batches=["Batch A", "Batch B", "Batch C"]
)

if result["status"] == "success":
    timetable = result["timetable"]
    print(f"Generated {len(timetable)} slots")
else:
    print(f"Failed: {result['reason']}")
```

### FastAPI Endpoint
```bash
POST /api/timetable/generate
Content-Type: application/json

{
  "department": "Computer Science",
  "week_config": {...},
  "subjects": [...],
  "rooms": [...]
}
```

## 🛠️ Extending the Solver

### Adding a New Constraint

1. Create constraint function:
```python
def add_your_constraint(model, variables, ...):
    """Your constraint description."""
    # Implementation
    logger.info("Added your constraint")
```

2. Call in `ModularTimetableSolver.solve()`:
```python
add_your_constraint(self.model, self.variables, ...)
```

### Modifying Variables

Edit `create_variables()` to add new dimensions:
```python
for new_dimension in new_dimensions:
    var = model.NewBoolVar(var_name)
    # Store metadata
```
