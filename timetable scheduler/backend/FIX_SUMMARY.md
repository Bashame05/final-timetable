# Complete Fix Summary - Data Flow Issue

## Problem Identified
- Solver receiving 0 variables (no subjects being passed)
- Frontend sending data correctly, but subjects array might be empty

## Fixes Applied

### 1. **Backend Solver (solver_relaxed.py)** ✅
- Added support for both old and new data formats
- `hours_per_week` field (new format from frontend)
- `theory_hours` + `practical_hours` (old format)
- Added detailed logging to track subject processing
- Handles missing subjects gracefully

### 2. **Data Models (data_models.py)** ✅
- Updated Subject model to accept:
  - `hours_per_week` (new format)
  - `theory_hours` (old format)
  - `practical_hours` (old format)
  - `teacher` field
- All fields are optional to support both formats

### 3. **API Routes (timetable_routes.py)** ✅
- Already using relaxed solver
- Handles data conversion properly

## How to Use

### Frontend to Backend Data Flow:
```
Frontend (script.js)
  ↓
  Collects subjects from appState.yearConfigs[year].subjects
  ↓
  Converts to: { name, type, hours_per_week }
  ↓
  Sends to: POST /api/timetable/generate
  ↓
Backend (solver_relaxed.py)
  ↓
  Receives subjects with hours_per_week
  ↓
  Creates variables for each subject
  ↓
  Solves and returns timetable
```

## Testing Steps

1. **Add subjects to Year 1:**
   - Go to "Generate Timetable" tab
   - Click on "Year 1" tab
   - Select subjects from dropdown
   - Set theory/practical hours
   - Click "Generate"

2. **Check logs:**
   - Should see: "Subject: [name], Type: [type], Hours: [hours]"
   - Should see: "Created X variables"
   - Should NOT see: "Created 0 variables"

3. **Verify output:**
   - Should generate timetable with one-hour slots
   - All subjects should be scheduled
   - No overlaps in rooms

## If Still Not Working

1. **Check frontend console:**
   - Open browser DevTools (F12)
   - Check "Sending payload" log
   - Verify subjects array is not empty

2. **Check backend logs:**
   - Should show subject processing
   - Should show variable creation
   - Should show constraint addition

3. **Verify data format:**
   - Frontend sends: `{ name, type, hours_per_week }`
   - Backend expects: `{ name, type, hours_per_week }`
   - Match confirmed ✅

## Files Modified

1. `backend/solver/solver_relaxed.py` - Added flexible data format handling
2. `backend/models/data_models.py` - Updated Subject model
3. `backend/routes/timetable_routes.py` - Already compatible

## Next Steps

1. Test with sample data
2. Verify timetable generation
3. Check constraint satisfaction
4. Deploy to production
