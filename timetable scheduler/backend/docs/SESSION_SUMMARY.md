# Timetable Generator - Session Summary

**Date**: Oct 21, 2025  
**Status**: ✅ Basic solver working, ready for Phase 2 enhancements

---

## 🎯 What We Accomplished

### Phase 1: Frontend-Backend Integration ✅
- ✅ Fixed duplicate function bug preventing timetable generation
- ✅ Connected frontend to backend API successfully
- ✅ Implemented timetable display in View Schedule tab
- ✅ Added event listeners for year dropdown filtering
- ✅ Multiple batches displaying correctly in same time slot

### Phase 2: Backend Solver Development ✅
- ✅ Created basic timetable solver (V4)
- ✅ Implemented strict hour enforcement
- ✅ Added theory/lab separation constraint
- ✅ Room type matching (theory→classroom, lab→lab)
- ✅ Support for theory+lab split subjects
- ✅ Comprehensive logging for debugging

## 📊 Current System Architecture

### Frontend (`timetable scheduler/timetableproject/`)
- `index.html` - Main UI with tabs for Generate, View, Departments, Rooms
- `script.js` - All frontend logic including form handling and API calls
- `styles.css` - Styling

### Backend (`backend/`)
- `main.py` - FastAPI server
- `routes/timetable_routes.py` - API endpoints
- `models/timetable_solver_v4.py` - **Current active solver**
- `models/data_models.py` - Pydantic models for validation

### Solvers Created (in order)
1. `timetable_solver_v2.py` - Batch distribution with optimization
2. `timetable_solver_v3.py` - Theory+lab split with consecutive practicals
3. `timetable_solver_custom.py` - Custom CP-SAT implementation
4. `timetable_solver_fixed.py` - Fixed hour enforcement attempt
5. `timetable_solver_final.py` - Final with detailed logging
6. `timetable_solver_simple.py` - Simplified structure
7. **`timetable_solver_v4.py`** - Current (theory/lab separation) ✅

## 🔧 Current Solver (V4) Features

### Constraints Implemented
✅ **Hour Enforcement**: Each subject gets exactly required hours  
✅ **Room Type Matching**: Theory in classrooms, practical in labs  
✅ **Theory/Lab Separation**: Same subject theory/lab not in same time slot  
✅ **Room No-Overlap**: One session per room per time slot  
✅ **Subject Type Support**: theory, lab, practical, theory+lab  

### Logging
- Subject loading with hours verification
- Constraint addition tracking
- Hour verification after solving
- Detailed status messages

## 🚀 Next Phase: Advanced Constraints

### Priority 1: Batch Scheduling
- [ ] All batches attend theory together (same classroom, same time)
- [ ] All batches do practicals simultaneously (different labs)
- [ ] Each batch in different lab with different teacher

### Priority 2: Split Lectures
- [ ] Multiple teachers for same subject
- [ ] Different batches assigned to different teachers
- [ ] Display multiple entries in same cell

### Priority 3: Teacher Fatigue
- [ ] Max 3 consecutive hours without break
- [ ] Lunch break enforcement (12:00-13:00)
- [ ] Break distribution

### Priority 4: Special Sessions
- [ ] Major Projects (≥2 hours, all batches, one teacher)
- [ ] Mini Projects (≤2 hours, 1-3 batches)
- [ ] Tutorials (≤2 hours, one batch)
- [ ] Elective subjects (split classes)

### Priority 5: Room Preferences
- [ ] Coordinator-specified preferred rooms
- [ ] Fixed room constraints
- [ ] Room availability management

## 🐛 Known Issues & Limitations

### Current Limitations
- No batch-specific scheduling yet
- No split lecture support
- No teacher fatigue constraints
- No room preferences
- No special session types
- No elective subject handling

### What Works
- ✅ Basic hour enforcement
- ✅ Theory/lab separation
- ✅ Room type matching
- ✅ Multiple subject types
- ✅ Timetable display

## 📝 Files Modified/Created

### Created
- `backend/models/timetable_solver_v4.py` (current)
- `backend/models/timetable_solver_v3.py`
- `backend/models/timetable_solver_v2.py`
- `BACKEND_IMPROVEMENTS.md`
- `SOLVER_V3_FEATURES.md`

### Modified
- `backend/routes/timetable_routes.py` (uses V4)
- `timetableproject/script.js` (fixed duplicate function)

## 🎓 Testing Checklist

### To Test Current System
1. ✅ Generate timetable with theory subjects
2. ✅ Generate timetable with practical subjects
3. ✅ Generate timetable with theory+lab subjects
4. ✅ Verify hours are exact
5. ✅ Verify theory in classrooms, practical in labs
6. ✅ Verify theory/lab not in same slot
7. ⏳ Test with multiple batches (needs batch scheduling)

## 💡 Key Insights

### What Worked Well
- Simple, direct variable structure in V4
- Clear constraint logging for debugging
- Separation of concerns (solver vs routes)
- OR-Tools CP-SAT is powerful for this problem

### What Needs Improvement
- Batch scheduling is complex (needs redesign)
- Split lectures require new data structures
- Teacher fatigue needs careful constraint design
- Room preferences need flexibility

---

## 🔄 Recommended Next Steps

1. **Implement batch scheduling** - This is the foundation for advanced features
2. **Add teacher management** - Track teacher assignments and fatigue
3. **Support split lectures** - Multiple teachers per subject
4. **Add special sessions** - Projects, tutorials, electives
5. **Room preference system** - Coordinator input handling

## 📞 Quick Reference

### Start Backend
```bash
cd backend
python main.py
```

### API Endpoint
```
POST http://localhost:8000/api/timetable/generate
```

### Current Solver
```python

## ✨ Summary

**Status**: Basic timetable solver working with hour enforcement and theory/lab separation.

**Ready for**: Phase 2 advanced constraints (batch scheduling, split lectures, teacher fatigue)

**Next Focus**: Batch-aware scheduling where all batches attend theory together but practicals separately.
