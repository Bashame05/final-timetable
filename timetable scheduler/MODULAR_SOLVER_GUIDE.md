## üèóÔ∏è Architecture Overview

### Modular Components

#### 1. **Utilities** (`generate_time_slots`, `check_feasibility`)
- Generate valid time slots excluding lunch breaks
- Quick feasibility check before solving
- Room filtering by subject type

#### 2. **Variables** (`create_variables`)
- Create CP-SAT boolean variables for all possible assignments
- Variables represent: `(subject, batch, room, day, hour, duration)`
- Supports flexible durations (1-2 hours)

#### 3. **Constraints** (Individual constraint functions)
- **No Overlap**: Room, batch, teacher conflicts
- **Room Type**: Theory‚Üíclassroom, Practical‚Üílab
- **Theory Sync**: All batches attend theory together
- **Practical Sync**: All batches do practicals simultaneously
- **Duration Limits**: Theory ‚â§2h, Practical =2h
- **Daily Limits**: Max 2h per subject per day
- **Subject Hours**: Each subject gets exact required hours
- **Teacher Fatigue**: Max 3 consecutive hours

#### 4. **Solver** (`ModularTimetableSolver`)
- Orchestrates model creation, constraint addition, and solving
- Handles error cases gracefully
- Extracts and formats solution

## üîß Core Hard Constraints Implemented

### 1. No Overlaps
```python
add_no_overlap_constraints()
- No room can host two sessions at same time
- No batch can attend two sessions at same time
```

### 2. Room Type Matching
```python
add_room_type_constraints()
- Theory only in classrooms
- Practical only in labs
```

### 3. Theory Batch Synchronization
```python
add_theory_batch_synchronization_constraint()
- All batches attend theory together
- Same time, same room, same teacher
```

### 4. Practical Batch Synchronization
```python
add_practical_batch_synchronization_constraint()
- All batches run practicals simultaneously
- Each batch in different lab
- Different teachers per batch
```

### 5. Duration Constraints
```python
add_duration_constraints()
- Theory: max 2 consecutive hours
- Practical: exactly 2 hours
```

### 6. Daily Hours Limit
```python
add_daily_hours_limit_constraint()
- Max 2 hours per subject per day per batch
```

### 7. Subject Hours
```python
add_subject_hours_constraint()
- Each subject gets exactly required hours per week
```

### 8. Teacher Fatigue
```python
add_teacher_fatigue_constraint()
- No teacher >3 consecutive hours without break
```

## üìä Data Format

### Input (from Frontend)
```json
{
  "week_config": {
    "working_days": ["Mon", "Tue", "Wed", "Thu", "Fri"],
    "week_start_time": "09:00",
    "week_end_time": "16:00",
    "lunch_start": "13:00",
    "lunch_end": "14:00"
  },
  "subjects": [
    {
      "name": "Mathematics",
      "type": "theory",
      "hours_per_week": 3
    },
    {
      "name": "Physics",
      "type": "theory+lab",
      "hours_per_week": 5
    }
  ],
  "rooms": [
    {
      "name": "C1",
      "type": "classroom",
      "capacity": 60,
      "location": "Building A"
    },
    {
      "name": "L1",
      "type": "lab",
      "capacity": 30,
      "location": "Building B"
    }
  ],
  "batches": ["Batch A", "Batch B", "Batch C"]
}
```

### Output (Success)
```json
{
  "status": "success",
  "timetable": [
    {
      "subject": "Mathematics",
      "batch": "Batch A",
      "room": "C1",
      "day": "Mon",
      "start_hour": 9,
      "end_hour": 11,
      "duration": 2,
      "type": "theory",
      "start_time": "09:00",
      "end_time": "11:00"
    },
    ...
  ],
  "stats": {
    "total_slots": 25,
    "subjects_scheduled": 5,
    "batches_scheduled": 3
  }
}
```

### Output (Failure)
```json
{
  "status": "failed",
  "reason": "Need 25h but only 15 slots available"
}
```

## üöÄ Usage

### Direct API Call
```python
from solver.solver_modular import generate_timetable

result = generate_timetable(
    week_config=week_config,
    subjects=subjects,
    rooms=rooms,
    batches=["Batch A", "Batch B", "Batch C"]
)

if result["status"] == "success":
    timetable = result["timetable"]
else:
    reason = result["reason"]
```

### Via FastAPI Endpoint
```bash
POST /api/timetable/generate
Content-Type: application/json

{
  "department": "Computer Science",
  "week_config": {...},
  "subjects": [...],
  "rooms": [...]
}
```

## üîç Logging

The solver provides detailed logging:

## üõ†Ô∏è Extending the Solver

### Adding New Constraints

1. Create a new function following the pattern:
```python
def add_your_constraint(model, variables, ...):
    """
    Constraint description.
    """
    # Implementation
    logger.info("Added your constraint")
```

2. Call it in `ModularTimetableSolver.solve()`:
```python
add_your_constraint(self.model, self.variables, ...)
```

### Modifying Variable Creation

Edit `create_variables()` to add new variable dimensions:
```python
for your_dimension in your_dimensions:
    # Create variables
    var = model.NewBoolVar(var_name)
```

## üîÑ Integration with Frontend

The solver output is automatically converted to `TimetableSlot` objects in the route:

```python
timetable_slots = [
    TimetableSlot(
        day=slot["day"],
        slot=f"{slot['start_time']}-{slot['end_time']}",
        subject=slot["subject"],
        room=slot["room"],
        type=slot["type"],
        teacher=slot.get("teacher")
    )
    for slot in timetable_data
]
```

## üöÄ Next Steps

1. **Teacher Management**: Add teacher assignment logic
2. **Split Lectures**: Support multiple teachers per subject
3. **Room Preferences**: Implement coordinator preferences
4. **Electives**: Add elective subject handling
5. **Special Sessions**: Implement major/mini projects
6. **Performance**: Optimize for larger problems (100+ subjects)
